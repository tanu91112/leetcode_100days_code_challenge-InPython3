#DAY1 : 217. Contains Duplicate                  DATE: 01-OCTOBER-2024

Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true

Explanation:
The element 1 occurs at the indices 0 and 3.

#DAY 2 : 242. Valid Anagram                      DATE: 02-OCTOBER-2024

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an 
anagram of s, and false otherwise.

 Example 1:

Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true


#DAY 3 :      1. Two Sum            DATE: 03-OCTOBER-2024

Hint
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

#DAY 4 :              DATE: 04-OCTOBER-2024

2491. Divide Players Into Teams of Equal Skill

You are given a positive integer array skill of even length n where skill[i] denotes the skill of the ith player. Divide the players into n / 2 teams of size 2 such that the total skill of each team is equal.
The chemistry of a team is equal to the product of the skills of the players on that team.
Return the sum of the chemistry of all the teams, or return -1 if there is no way to divide the players into teams such that the total skill of each team is equal.

Example 1:

Input: skill = [3,2,5,1,3,4]
Output: 22
Explanation: 
Divide the players into the following teams: (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), where each team has a total skill of 6.
The sum of the chemistry of all the teams is: 1 * 5 + 2 * 4 + 3 * 3 = 5 + 8 + 9 = 22.
