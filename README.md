#DAY1 : 217. Contains Duplicate                  DATE: 01-OCTOBER-2024

Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true

Explanation:
The element 1 occurs at the indices 0 and 3.

#DAY 2 : 242. Valid Anagram                      DATE: 02-OCTOBER-2024

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an 
anagram of s, and false otherwise.

 Example 1:

Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true


#DAY 3 :      1. Two Sum            DATE: 03-OCTOBER-2024

Hint
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
